# Exam project for 27460 Synthetic Biology Fall 2025 - Group 1
This repository contains the code, workflow and data used to design and generate synthetic promoters and constructs for **in vivo assembly** in ***Coprinopsis cinerea*** using teemi! This work supports the project:
**"Expression of omega-3 DHA PUFA synthesis in non-conventional host: *Coprinopsis cinerea*."**

### Summary
In this project a library of candidate promoters and terminators were created by cross-referencing commonly used elements (e.g., TEF1) from model organisms with homologous regions in the *C.cinerea* genome. For each region, 1000 bp were extracted and analyzed as potential promoter and terminator sequences.

The repository includes:
- **Notebooks** for:
    - Synthetic promoter generation
    - Promoter and terminator screening using dTomato
    - Construct assembly and cloning
- **Results** achieved from the design workflow
- **Sequences** used in this project

For the full methodology please refer to the report: **"Expression of omega-3 DHA PUFA synthesis in non-conventional host: *Coprinopsis cinerea*."**

### Usage
To explore the workflow, **open the notebooks in the `/notebooks/` directory** and follow them in order:

1. **Synthetic promoter generation**  
2. **Combinatorial library and assembly**  
3. **Construct assembly**
