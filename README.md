# Exam project for 27460 Synthetic Biology Fall 2025 - Group 1
This repo contains the code and process to generate synthetic promoters and constructs for in vivo assembly using teemi!

In this project a library of promoters and terminators were created by cross reference of typically strong promoters, such as TEF1, in model organisms with C.Cinerea genome and 1000 base-pairs was collected from up and downstream segments of the coding sequence.

For a comprehensive overview and complete description of project, please refer to the report: "Expression of omega-3 PUFA synthesis in non-conventinal host: Coprinopsis Cinerea".
